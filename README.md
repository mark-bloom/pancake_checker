# pancake_checker
Checking the temperature for cheap pancakes using pushnotifer

Uses the [PushNotifier](https://pushnotifier.de/) application, and the [Python API](https://github.com/tomg404/pushnotifier-python) to check the Pancake Parlour website for temperatures and notify of cheap pancakes.

Uses a local version of pushnotifer-python with corrected exceptions, but should be able to edit pancakes.py to use the online version.

Includes a batch script for Windows scheduling
